      <item value="&lt;p&gt;Both Spring Web MVC and Spring WebFlux support this annotation through the {@code RequestMappingHandlerMapping} in their respective modules. The values from each type and method level pair of annotations are added to a {@link CorsConfiguration} and then default values are applied via {@link CorsConfigurationapplyPermitDefaultValues()}." />
      <item value="&lt;p&gt;If {@link WebMvcConfigurer} does not expose some more advanced setting that needs to be configured consider removing the {@code @EnableWebMvc} annotation and extending directly from {@link WebMvcConfigurationSupport} or {@link DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration}, e.g.:" />

      <item value="This is the main class providing the configuration behind the MVC Java config.

      <item value="Indicates that an annotation type is automatically inherited. If an Inherited meta-annotation is present on an annotation type declaration, and the user queries the annotation type on a class declaration, and the class declaration has no annotation for this type, then the class's superclass will automatically be queried for the annotation type. This process will be repeated until an annotation for this type is found, or the top of the class hierarchy (Object) is reached. If no superclass has an annotation for this type, then the query will indicate that the class in question has no such annotation" />
      <item value="Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed, but will reuse previously constructed threads when they are available. These pools will typically improve the performance of programs that execute many short-lived asynchronous tasks. Calls to {@code execute} will reuse previously constructed threads if available. If no existing thread is available, a new thread will be created and added to the pool. Threads that have not been used for sixty seconds are terminated and removed from the cache. Thus, a pool that remains idle for long enough will not consume any resources. Note that pools with similar properties but different details (for example, timeout parameters) may be created using {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} constructors" />

      <item value="The bin count threshold for using a tree rather than list for a bin. Bins are converted to trees when adding an element to a bin with at least this many nodes. The value must be greater than 2 and should be at least 8 to mesh with assumptions in tree removal about conversion back to plain bins upon shrinkage." />
      <item value="* Rounding mode to round towards the {@literal &quot;nearest neighbor&quot;} * unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case, round * towards the even neighbor. Behaves as for * {@code RoundingMode.HALF_UP} if the digit to the left of the * discarded fraction is odd; behaves as for * {@code RoundingMode.HALF_DOWN} if it's even. Note that this * is the rounding mode that statistically minimizes cumulative * error when applied repeatedly over a sequence of calculations. * It is sometimes known as {@literal &quot;Banker's rounding,&quot;} and is * chiefly used in the USA. This rounding mode is analogous to * the rounding policy used for {@code float} and {@code double} * arithmetic in Java." />
      <item value="* When a {@code double} must be used as a source for a * {@code BigDecimal}, note that this constructor provides an * exact conversion; it does not give the same result as * converting the {@code double} to a {@code String} using the * {@link Double#toString(double)} method and then using the * {@link #BigDecimal(String)} constructor. To get that result, * use the {@code static} {@link #valueOf(double)} method." />
      <item value="* The {@code String} constructor, on the other hand, is * perfectly predictable: writing {@code new BigDecimal(&quot;0.1&quot;)} * creates a {@code BigDecimal} which is &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; equal to * 0.1, as one would expect. Therefore, it is generally * recommended that the {@linkplain #BigDecimal(String) * &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt; constructor} be used in preference to this one." />
      <item value="* This is because 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a * {@code double} (or, for that matter, as a binary fraction of * any finite length). Thus, the value that is being passed * &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; to the constructor is not exactly equal to 0.1, * appearances notwithstanding." />
      <item value="* The results of this constructor can be somewhat unpredictable. * One might assume that writing {@code new BigDecimal(0.1)} in * Java creates a {@code BigDecimal} which is exactly equal to * 0.1 (an unscaled value of 1, with a scale of 1), but it is * actually equal to * 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625." />
      <item value="* Translates a {@code double} into a {@code BigDecimal} which * is the exact decimal representation of the {@code double}'s * binary floating-point value.

      <item value="* The number of decimal digits in this BigDecimal, or 0 if the * number of digits are not known (lookaside information). If * nonzero, the value is guaranteed correct.
